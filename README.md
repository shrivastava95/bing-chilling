## Introduction

Bing Chilling is a Python project that leverages the Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with Microsoft Bing's AI Chatbot. Designed to mimic human interaction, it enables users to send both text and images to the Bing Chat AI and receive comprehensive responses. This project is invaluable for researchers, developers, and hobbyists interested in exploring conversational AI dynamics.

## Features

- **Text Queries**: Send text-based queries and receive detailed responses from Bing Chat AI.
- **Image Queries**: Ability to upload images from URLs or local storage and ask contextual questions.
- **Flexible Tone Setting**: Set the chatbot's response tone to either balanced, creative, or precise.
- **Automated Interactions**: Fully automated interactions with the Bing Chat AI, including uploading images, sending queries, and fetching responses.
- **Customizable**: Easily customizable for various applications and research purposes.
- **Debugging Tools**: Included debug functions for easier troubleshooting during implementation.

    return args

def main(args):
    bot = BingBot(args.driver_path)

    # Open Bing Chat
    bot.driver.get(args.bing_chat_url)

    # Set the tone for Bing Chat (options: balanced, creative, precise)
    bot.change_tone('precise')

    # Write a question to Bing Chat
    bot.write_text('Can you provide information about the Eiffel Tower?')

    # Press enter to send the query
    bot.send_query()

    # Get response from Bing (waits until Bing finishes responding)
